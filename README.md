## Description

**Pedestrian Obstacle Detector** is an Android application designed to keep both visually impaired users and distracted pedestrians safe by detecting obstacles in real time using an on-device deep-learning model. The app continuously analyzes the camera feed, raising an audio alert for blind or low-vision users and a haptic (vibration) alert for sighted users who may be focused on their phone.

Under the hood, the application uses a customized YOLOv8 model retrained on a Roboflow-managed dataset of 18 obstacle classes (e.g., road edges, vehicles, pedestrians, trash bins) and optimizes inference through model quantization. After original inference times of 2.63 s, customization and pruning reduced this to 0.79 s, and with Float16 and full INT8 quantization, latency dropped to 0.68 s and 0.595 s respectively, enabling true real-time performance constrainted mobile devices.

The training pipeline leveraged Google Colab for initial model fine-tuning, with Roboflow’s annotation and augmentation tools streamlining dataset preparation and versioning. quantization strategies and edge-computing techniques further balance speed and accuracy, achieving 83 % overall mAP and up to 92 % for key classes like roads, vehicles, and people.

Built entirely in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for a modern, reactive UI, the app integrates Kotlin Coroutines for seamless multithreading, Android’s TextToSpeech API for voice alerts, TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference, and NNAPI where available to accelerate quantized models.

## Requirements

- **Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher**  
- **Kotlin**  
- **Jetpack Compose**  
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8** (model and scripts)  
- **Roboflow** (dataset management)  
- **TensorFlow Lite** (+ INT8 quantization support)  
- **Kotlinx Coroutines**  
- **Android TextToSpeech**  
- **Vibrator** (Haptic feedback)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone** this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Real-time-Obstacle-Detector/Android-Application.git
   cd ObstacleDetector-Android

2. Open in Android Studio and Sync Gradle

3. Add your trained .tflite model into app/src/main/assets/model.tflite

4. Place demo images under app/src/main/res/drawable/demo1.png … demo5.png for test sections

5. Run on your device or emulator with camera support
